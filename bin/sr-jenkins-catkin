# Jenkins build script to make and test a ros package. The package, with its
# stack is also expected to be checked out into $WORKSPACE, which is what
# jenkins does.
# * Creates an overlay in $WORKSPACE of the installed ros and shadow dependancies.
# * Fixes test out put to be under jenkins workspace so jenkins can see it.
# * Fixes rostest rubbish xml out put (https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/3770)
# * Put ros logs into $WORKSPACE/logs so jenkins can see them.
