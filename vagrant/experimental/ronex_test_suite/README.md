# RoNeX Serial DB

Note that this will need ansible 1.7 or later to build properly.

## Running vagrant provision

I needed to set my locales to us for the script not to fail. In the terminal from which I run `vagrant provision`:

```
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8
```

## Logging in the web ui
Default login / password is ronexserial / shadow.
